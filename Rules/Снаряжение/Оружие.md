SLAKING BLADE  
Infused with sadistic sentience, Slaking Blades drink  
deep when they taste blood. Milyenne keeps her blade in  
the only sunny clearing on the Vergraven estate, as if to  
torment it. Anyone who touches the blade senses its vast  
but near-comatose intelligence, and when spoken to the  
sword only repeats a single telepathic word: ‘Traitor…’  
A Slaking Blade is a Greatsword (Soulbound page 103)  
that deals +1 Damage against creatures with blood. The  
first time it inflicts a Deadly Wound during combat, it  
awakens. The bearer’s Melee increases one step and the  
bearer heals 3 Toughness whenever they inflict a Wound  
until the end of combat.
