SCABBING PLATE  
Soulblight Vampires favour heavy plate enchanted to  
drink blood as greedily as their wearers. Milyenne’s set,  
beneath its black crust of gore, bears a filigree of roaring  
wyrms on its pauldrons. It has not been used or worn in  
centuries.  
A set of Scabbing Plate is Heavy Armour (Soulbound  
page 104). If its Armour value has been reduced below its  
maximum, such as from Rend, the Scabbing Plate restores  
1 point of Armour whenever its wearer inflicts a Wound. If  
the Scabbing Plate’s Armour value is at its maximum, the  
wearer heals 3 Toughness whenever they inflict a Wound.  
Stormcast Eternals cannot wear Scabbing Plate
